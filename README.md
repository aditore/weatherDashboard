## Description

Homework 6 had us create a UI to allow a user to search for a city to show them the current weather of that city along with some other information.

This project was built to allow a user to secure information on the weather for any city that they choose.

I learned how to use a function to call upon an API, by applying what we have learned so far I was able to successfully solidify some things that I had previously learned.

## Usage

The UI allows a search button to be pushed after any city is entered into the search to show the weather conditions of that city.

The most recent search are saved to local storage to allow them to be shown when the user refreshes the page.

The recent searches can also be clicked on to allow the user to not have to search for the same city again.

NOTE: the 'CLEAR HISTORY' button is incomplete and does NOT function properly
