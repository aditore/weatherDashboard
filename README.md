## Usage

The UI allows a search button to be pushed after any city has been typed into the search to show the weather conditions of that city.</br>
The search button calls upon the Open Weather Map API to get the data the website needs to render html content.</br>
The most recent searches are saved to local storage to allow them to be shown when the user refreshes the page.</br>
The recent searches can also be clicked on to allow the user to not have to search for the same city again.</br>
The clear history button can be clicked on to allow the user to clear their local storage and reload the page.</br>
